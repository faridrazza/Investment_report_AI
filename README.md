**Project: AI-Powered Investment Report Generator for Asset Management Firms**

**Overview:**
I built an application designed specifically for asset management firms to automate the process of generating detailed investment reports. Traditionally, creating these reports involved manual data collection, formatting, and analysis — a time-consuming and error-prone process. Our solution streamlines this workflow using AI and cloud-based infrastructure.

**Key Features:**

Automated Data Ingestion:
The system pulls data from multiple financial sources (APIs, internal databases, Excel/CSV files).

Natural Language Summarization:
Using LLMs (e.g., OpenAI or Bedrock), the app generates executive summaries, performance insights, and risk analysis in a clear and professional tone.

Template-Based Report Assembly:
Customizable report templates allow firms to standardize branding and structure. The output can be downloaded in PDF or shared via a secure link.

Interactive Q&A:
Users can ask questions about the data (e.g., “What was the ROI on tech sector investments last quarter?”), and the system responds using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework.

Compliance-Ready Output:
Reports are generated with version history and audit trails to meet regulatory standards.

**Tech Stack:**

Frontend: React + Tailwind

Backend: Node.js + AWS Lambda

Database: PostgreSQL (or Supabase)

AI Layer: OpenAI GPT or Amazon Bedrock

Storage & Deployment: AWS S3, CloudFront, SAM/CloudFormation

Impact:
This tool significantly reduced the time to generate reports (from hours to minutes), improved accuracy, and allowed investment teams to focus more on analysis and strategy rather than formatting and data wrangling.
